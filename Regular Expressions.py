# Regular Expressions are used to search for patterns in a string or text
# Raw strings are what regular expressions are and what they are used on
# print(r"Hello \n World")

# import the regular expression module
# Match
# import re
# string = "abc"
# pattern = "a"
# if re.match(pattern, string):
#     print('Match found')
# else:
#     print('No match found')

# Search
# import re
# string = "bca"
# pattern = "a"
# if re.search(pattern, string):
#     print('Match found')
# else:
#     print('No match found')

# Metacharacters in regular expressions
# They are a special set of characters which don't match themselves, instead, they create some pattern which should be matched.
# Examples: *, +, {...}, ., ?, ^
# * - makes sure that a particular character preceding it is present 0 or more times
